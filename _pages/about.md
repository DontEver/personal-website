## Hey there! I'm Xinci Ma 👋

I’m a passionate Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) student with a deep interest in exploring how technology shapes our world. My journey began in Shanghai, China, where I grew up before moving to New York City. Navigating a new culture and language at a young age taught me resilience and adaptability—traits that have shaped my approach to both life and engineering.

### My Journey So Far 🌏
After moving to the United States, I discovered my love for computers, technology, and engineering. Now, as a student at The Ohio State University, I’m diving deep into computer science and engineering, constantly learning and pushing my limits. From coding projects to hardware design, I’m driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.

### What You’ll Find Here 💻
On this site, I share my projects, insights, and the occasional deep dive into technical topics that excite me. Some things you can expect include:
- **Coding Projects**: Explorations and practical applications in Java, C, C++, and more.
- **Engineering Challenges**: Problem-solving in circuits, signal processing, and system design.

### Fun Facts 🎉
- I’m a huge dog lover and have two dogs who keep me on my toes!
- When I’m not working on a project or studying, you’ll probably find me reading up on the latest in tech or enjoying the outdoors.
