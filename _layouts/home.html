<h2>Hey there! I'm Xinci Ma 👋</h2>
<p>I’m a passionate Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) student with a deep interest in exploring how technology shapes our world. My journey began in Shanghai, China, where I grew up before moving to New York City. Navigating a new culture and language at a young age taught me resilience and adaptability—traits that have shaped my approach to both life and engineering.</p>

<h3>My Journey So Far 🌏</h3>
<p>After moving to the United States, I discovered my love for computers, technology, and engineering. Now, as a student at Ohio State University, I’m diving deep into computer science and engineering, constantly learning and pushing my limits. From coding projects to hardware design, I’m driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.</p>

<h3>What You’ll Find Here 💻</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coding Projects</strong>: Explorations and practical applications in Java, C, C++, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering Challenges</strong>: Problem-solving in circuits, signal processing, and system design.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fun Facts 🎉</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I’m a huge dog lover and have two dogs who keep me on my toes!</li>
  <li>When I’m not working on a project or studying, you’ll probably find me reading up on the latest in tech or enjoying the outdoors.</li>
</ul>
